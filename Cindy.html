        <h1>Message from Ryan to Cindy</h1>
        <div class="message">
            <p class="intro">Okay, I have tried everything I can to figure out how to start my response. I even came close to asking ChatGPT, for crying out loud 😭😭. But finally, after taking yesterday before going out to really think it through, I have finally come up with a few words. I’ll try my very best.</p>
            <p class="initial-thoughts">Anyway, when I first got the message, I immediately texted one of my friends, “I knew it.” Because initially, when I started talking to you, I thought to myself, 'What is a guy like me going to do with such a beautiful woman like Cindy? We'll probably meet, and she'll call it quits, you know?' So when I saw the message, I was actually very, very hurt.</p>
            <p class="first">First of all, I started overthinking. The inevitable happened; I'll never forget the events of that night – the overthinking, the crying. I couldn’t sleep. The next day was also very hectic; I just couldn’t bring myself to accept it. I thought this was just another nightmare, and I’m still asleep.</p>
            <p class="second">Let me not lie, Cindy. I’ve gone through something similar in a talking stage, so my pessimistic side kept telling me the same thing would happen. But I was like, 'Nah, this situation will be different. This is not the same.' And if it was going to be the same, I’ll try my best, my very best, to fight for it. Because, first of all, Cindy, let me be honest (and please don’t let this scare you): I have never liked someone like this before. You’re literally so perfect, like literally everything I’ve wished for, to the tee. I remember when you asked me if I learned the ‘rizz’ from somewhere, and I told you it only comes naturally if I really, really like someone. And I meant it. I have never talked to someone the way I do to you, and I don’t think I will anytime soon. I get you are scared. I get you are trying to protect me. I get that, and I respect that.</p>
            <p class="third">First of all, I really rate the fact that you had the balls to send that message, because I know it is not easy. It isn’t. I have this saying that nothing is ever easy. No relationship doesn’t have problems, from friendships to family; they all have problems. And listen, Cindy, I told you I’ll always be there for you, and I meant it. I’m willing to help you work through this. And the time I was sending the messages, I was speaking my mind. I didn’t mean to love bomb you. And listen, I’ll stop the love bombing. Also, I get the part where you want to enjoy your own company, and that doesn’t have to change because of me. I’m not here to make your life harder but to make it easier. We can reduce the calls; it doesn’t have to be every day. I’m willing to do all that, and I’m really sorry about your last relationship, from the toxicity to the manipulation and the disrespect. I’m really sorry about that, and I’m willing to be here for you. I know you have done a lot of work to fully get over it. I know it’s not easy, 'cause I have been in your position before. I’m willing to be there for you, Cindy. I'm here to support you in any way I can. I’ll be there to listen when you're ready to talk. Please know that I'm willing to work through any challenges together and that my feelings for you are genuine. It’s not just some infatuation.</p>
            <p class="fourth">The last three weeks have literally been nothing short of beautiful talking to you. I have really, really enjoyed it. And trust me, I’m not usually this open with someone, especially not right off the bat.Even my uni friends it took timeee But with you, it's been effortless from day one.I knew from the start that you were everything I’ve ever wanted.I knew this was everything I ever wanted. I even journaled and told my journal how I met you and how I knew from the get-go you’re nothing short of all I dreamed/wished for. And honestly, Cindy, I’m willing to fight for that. I’m willing to try my very, very best to make this work. And all I request is for you to give me a second chance. Let’s give it a try. Don’t snip the bud yet out of fear you will mess it up. Don’t call it quits. And as you said, I deserve the best things this world has to offer. And let me be honest, you are the best this world has to offer, Cindy Vera. You’re literally the best it has to offer. Don’t be scared of messing up. We can take it one day at a time, step by step, Cindy, but I am ready and willing to try and make it work.</p>
            <p class="closing-thoughts">Regards, Ryan Wesly</p>
